# DenseDepth
Depth estimation from a single rgb image. It's a pytorch version adapted from the [official repository](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth).  
The weights file format has been adapted to use it directly by the Pytorch model instead of converting them from the Keras format each run.
You can download the weights file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yZvaWvxDNQGtoZyJ-quqLRklojWWGAUN/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the data older.
